## 3D

Have you ever wanted to get a 3D view of the entire world? [One of our users did](https://github.com/orgs/foxglove/discussions/941), but had some issues with [z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) that kept the visualization within Foxglove from looking as sharp as it should. We think that outer-space fighting should be limited to intergalactic battles, so we added a **new setting to enable aÂ [logarithmic depth buffer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/logarithmic-depth-buffer), which can improve rendering precision for large distance scales**.

Using this feature may lead to a loss in rendering performance, but may be worth the price for users looking to visualize Earth-scale data, large maps, or just wanting to zoom in/out really, really far.

In this example below:

- The left pane does not use logarithmic depth, and it has a near clipping plane of 1.0. The grids render smoothly, but objects close to the viewer are clipped.
- The middle pane does not use logarithmic depth, and has a near plane of 0.01. The viewer can get closer to objects without clipping, but rendering artifacts (z-fighting) appear between multiple grids.
- The right pane enables the new logarithmic depth setting. This avoids z-fighting by providing more depth precision for the grids, while still allowing a near plane value of 0.01 for reduced clipping.

## Services

The Service Call panel now has an option to hide the request and response text fields. This allows you to configure a request once up front, then invoke the service call without any distractions. We love distractions, but only the kinds that have wet noses and wagging tails.

## JSON data sources

- When using a WebSocket connection, JSON channels and services with no schema are now supported (using an empty string for the schema name and data).
- Added support for fixed-length arrays (specified with `prefixItems`).

## Stability and usability

- The web application no longer encounters errors when a new version is released while the app is already open.
- Various usability enhancements to Recordings, General and Team settings, Webhooks, data playback while buffering, and deep linking.
- Improvements to error messages for opening incompatible files and layouts, and for WebSocket connections that encounter unexpected server behavior.
